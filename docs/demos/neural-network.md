## What is XOR?

**XOR (Exclusive OR)** is a logical operation that outputs `true` (1) only when inputs differ:

| Input A | Input B | XOR Output |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 0       | 0       | **0**      |
| 0       | 1       | **1**      |
| 1       | 0       | **1**      |
| 1       | 1       | **0**      |

### Why XOR is Perfect for Learning

XOR is the **simplest problem that requires a hidden layer**:

- **Linear separability**: You cannot draw a single straight line to separate the outputs
- **Requires feature combination**: The network must learn that "inputs differ" is the pattern
- **Classic test**: If a neural network can learn XOR, it has the capacity for non-linear learning

### What the Network is Learning

The demo shows a **2→4→1 network** learning XOR through these steps:

1. **Random initialization**: Weights start random, predictions are terrible
2. **Forward pass**: Input flows through network, producing a prediction (0 to 1)
3. **Calculate error**: Compare prediction to actual XOR answer
4. **Backpropagation**: Calculate how to adjust each weight to reduce error
5. **Update weights**: Apply gradients to make predictions slightly better
6. **Repeat**: After many iterations, the network learns the XOR pattern

**Watch for**:
- Early training: Loss is high (~0.7), predictions random
- Middle training: Loss decreases, patterns start emerging
- Convergence: Loss near 0, all 4 XOR cases predicted correctly

The **Data Visualization** tab shows the 4 training points and how the network classifies them in the input space.

## What This Demo Teaches

### 1. How Neural Networks Learn

Watch a network solve the XOR problem from random initialization:
- **Initial state**: Random weights, terrible predictions
- **Training**: Gradual weight adjustments via backpropagation
- **Convergence**: Network learns the correct pattern

### 2. Forward Pass in Detail

See each computation step:
```
Input layer → Hidden layer:
  z₀ = x₀ · w₀₀ + x₁ · w₁₀ + b₀
  a₀ = sigmoid(z₀)

Hidden layer → Output:
  z_out = a₀ · w₀₀ + a₁ · w₀₁ + ... + b_out
  prediction = sigmoid(z_out)
```

Every value is shown with actual numbers.

### 3. Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

See how errors propagate backward:
```
Output error → Hidden layer error → Weight gradients
```

The chain rule is made explicit at each step.

### 4. Why Hidden Layers Matter

XOR is not linearly separable:
- **Without hidden layer**: Cannot solve XOR
- **With hidden layer**: Network creates new features (intermediate representations)
- **Visualization**: See how hidden neurons create separable representations

## Understanding the Architecture

### Network Structure: 2 → 4 → 1

**Input layer** (2 neurons):
- Takes two binary inputs (0 or 1)

**Hidden layer** (4 neurons):
- Creates intermediate representations
- Learns features like "AND" and "OR"
- Uses sigmoid activation

**Output layer** (1 neuron):
- Combines hidden features
- Produces final prediction (0 to 1)

### Why 4 Hidden Neurons?

Could solve XOR with 2-3 hidden neurons, but 4 provides:
- More capacity for learning
- Clearer visualization of path strengths
- Redundancy for noisy data

## Common Questions

### Why does loss sometimes increase?

**Reasons**:
1. Learning rate too high → overshooting optima
2. Noisy training data → memorizing wrong patterns
3. Stochastic training → batch-to-batch variance

**Experiment**: Lower the learning rate and watch convergence smooth out.

### Why do some weights grow very large?

**Answer**: The network is becoming confident. Large weights → steep sigmoid → predictions close to 0 or 1.

**Experiment**: Enable "confidence penalty" to discourage extreme weights.

### What are path strengths?

**Path strength** = product of weights along a path from input to output.

**Example**: Input x₀ → Hidden h₂ → Output
```
Path strength = w[0→2] × w[2→out]
```

Strong paths dominate the network's computation.

**Experiment**: Click "Parameter Graphs" tab to see path evolution.

## Learning Exercises

### Beginner

1. **Watch one full training run**: Observe loss decreasing
2. **Inspect final weights**: Which paths matter most?
3. **Reset and compare**: Do different random starts converge to similar solutions?

### Intermediate

1. **Learning rate experiments**:
   - Try 0.1 (default), 0.5, 1.0, 2.0
   - When does training become unstable?

2. **Data size impact**:
   - Train with 50 vs 500 samples
   - Does more data always help?

3. **Noise robustness**:
   - Add 10%, 20%, 30% noise
   - At what point does learning fail?

### Advanced

1. **Hypothesis testing**:
   - Form a hypothesis (e.g., "larger learning rate = faster convergence")
   - Test it systematically
   - Analyze results

2. **Path analysis**:
   - Identify the dominant path at convergence
   - What does this path compute?
   - Why is it stronger than others?

3. **Initialization sensitivity**:
   - Run 10 training sessions
   - Do they all find similar solutions?
   - What varies? What stays constant?

## Technical Implementation

### Pure TypeScript

No ML libraries - everything implemented from scratch:
- Forward pass computation
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Weight updates
- Loss calculation

**Why?** Understanding the implementation is part of the learning.

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite ensures correctness:
- Forward pass produces correct shapes
- Gradients computed accurately
- Weight updates applied correctly
- Loss decreases over training
